# omscs-courses

Simple webpage/webapp to display the courses offered by [Georgia Tech's OMSCS program](http://www.omscs.gatech.edu). Also, a playground for me to practice TypeScript/JavaScript and AngularJS.

A live version can be found at [http://oszkar.github.io/omscs-courses/](http://oszkar.github.io/omscs-courses/). Latest code is on `master`, live code is on `gh-pages` branch.

I'm still fiddling around with the features and the code - as some basic stuff already works, let's call it alpha stage.
