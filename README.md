# omscs-courses

Simple webpage/webapp to display the courses offered by [Georgia Tech's OMSCS program](http://www.omscs.gatech.edu) and maybe a useful tool for OMSCS students when looking for classes to take or checking the requirements of a specialization. Also, a playground for me to practice TypeScript/JavaScript and AngularJS.

A live version can be found at [http://oszkar.github.io/omscs-courses/](http://oszkar.github.io/omscs-courses/). Latest code is on `master`, live code is on `gh-pages` branch.

### TODO/roadmap/planned features

##### ~What is done~

* JSON databases
* Course/specialization/course.vs.specialization.maxtrix view
* Menu/color codes/info page
* Github.io page
* Cookie handling so one can select which courses he/she completed so far
* More links (grades, student review site, etc.)

##### ~Would be nice to have~~

Would-be-nice-to-have features for the future/2.0:

* Cleanup of TS code and HTML
* Instructor view
* API to query and/or edit the databases
* Nicer look&feel
* Option to select in which specialization is one interested in + class suggestions based on this info
